# RPMDeathEffects
A small RPM plugin that spawns MythicMobs on death

# How to use?
The plugin contains only one command /setkillef <effect-name>

which sets the effect that will be applied after the player's death

An effect is just a MythicMob's mob that will be spawned at the event of player death

The command allows player to choose which effect will be active at their death

Each effect has 2 srttings: the mob type name and the permission that the player needs to have

in order to set this effect, which can be used for access control

# Why open source?
It's a small plugin that I made for RPM server for free so

I think it will be a good thing to open source it so everyone could use it

Just don't violate the AGPL licence :) Make the code also open source if you modify it in any way and use it in a production setting
